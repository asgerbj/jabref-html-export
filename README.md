# JabRef HTML Export
JabRef HTML export template to create a simple numerated list of publications in format of A. Surname, B. Surname, &amp; C. Surname, "Title of publication", Journal/Conference, vol., no., pp., month year, (doi: id)

Example: http://asgerbj.dk/index.php?p=publications

Template originally adopted from Daniel Haertle at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

To install and use custom export lists in JabRef:

- Add html_list.layout to Options -> Manage custom exports
- File -> Export all entries

Notes: 
1) You can control the numbering by putting a number in the field "Comment" in JabRef. Not numeric comments are ignored.
2) Alternatively, the ordering is as in your current main table (for instance sort by year).
